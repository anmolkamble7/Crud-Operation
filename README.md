# Crud-Operation

The Product CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application is a Spring Boot-based web application designed to manage product data. It provides a RESTful API that allows users to perform essential CRUD operations on product entities, such as creating new products, retrieving product information, updating existing products, and deleting products from the database.

The primary goal of the project is to offer a user-friendly and efficient way to manage product information within an organization. It is particularly useful for e-commerce platforms, inventory management systems, or any application that deals with product data.

Key Features:

Create Products: Users can create new products by providing necessary details such as product name, description, and price. Upon creation, the new product is stored in the application's database, making it accessible for future use.

Retrieve Product Information: The application enables users to retrieve product details based on various criteria, such as product ID or specific search parameters. This feature allows users to access product information quickly and easily.

Update Products: Users can modify existing product information, such as changing the product name, updating the description, or adjusting the price. The application ensures that changes are appropriately reflected in the database.

Delete Products: The application allows users to remove products from the database based on their product ID. This feature helps keep the product database organized and up-to-date.

Database Storage: The product data is persistently stored in a relational database, ensuring that the information remains accessible even after the application is restarted.

RESTful API: The application follows RESTful principles, making it easy.
